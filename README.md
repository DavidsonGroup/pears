Pipeline for gEne-fusion seArching in Rna Single-cell sequences 
- Aim: combine and increase finding power of fusions in single-cell RNA-seq data
- Adapted from: fuscia (Steven Foltz 2019) and flexiplex (2022)

- recommed running flexiplex on high confidence or have a threshold of number of spanning reads found with short-read functions
  - running flexiplex on the whole dataset, unless you are able to do this on several threads
